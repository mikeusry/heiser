### üìã Known Issues / TODO
1. **Missing Logo PNG**: Navigation uses `/heiser-logo.png` but file doesn't exist
   - Workaround: Created SVG version at `/public/logo.svg`
   - Need: User to provide actual PNG logo

2. **Privacy Policy Page**: Footer links to `/privacy-policy` but page not created

4. **SEO**: No meta tags or Open Graph images yet

   - Files: `public/chicagoland.tiff`, `.png`, `.svg` (wrapper only)
   - Future: Integrate creatively into footer design

npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### üìù Important Technical Notes

1. **Tailwind v4 Limitations**:
   - @apply directive not fully compatible
   - Use plain CSS in style blocks instead

2. **Cloudinary Image URLs**:
   - Base: `https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/`
   - Transformations: `/image/upload/w_400,h_600,c_fill,g_face/`
   - Public IDs: `heiser/heiser/[filename]`

3. **Component Imports**:
   - Layout: `BaseLayout` not `Layout`
   - Always check correct import paths

4. **CSS Specificity**:
   - Avoid setting colors on base elements (h1-h6) in global.css
   - Let Tailwind utility classes override

### üé® Design System Reference

- Color palette with usage guidelines
