  "text": "Realty Cleaning | Perfecting Showing in Chicagoland\nOur Realty Cleaning service is satisfaction guaranteed for all realtors, homebuyers, and clients. The Heiser Group ensures that with our thorough cleaning, your property will be picture perfect and ready to leave the best first impression every time.\nAs a real estate agent, one of your major responsibilities is to make sure that all houses you show are clean. The most essential thing to accomplish when trying to sell a property is to enhance the details of the space and keep the maintenance up to date. A filthy house may have a significant influence on the final price and the amount of time it takes to sell. From the floors through the kitchen and bathrooms to the windows, driveway, and garage, real estate cleaning will create the vision for potential buyers of making this house - their home.\nThat is when our cleaning business comes in to help! We have worked with countless realtors and understand your specific needs and priorities. We strive to provide the best cleaning that will help you sell houses more quickly and make a bigger commission.\nThe distinction between attempting to sell a filthy house and one that has been properly cleaned is like ‘night and day.' As a result, displaying a clean home pays big dividends.

  "text": "Bi-Weekly Cleaning Service | Residential & Commercial\nWhat do I get in a bi-weekly cleaning service?\nA bi-weekly cleaning service includes a range of cleaning tasks that are performed every other week to maintain the cleanliness of your home or office. The specific tasks may vary depending on your needs and preferences. Common cleaning tasks include:\nDusting all surfaces, including furniture, shelves, picture frames, and decorative items\nCleaning bathrooms, including scrubbing toilets, sinks, showers, and bathtubs\nCleaning the kitchen, including the counters, stove, microwave, refrigerator exterior, and sink\nVacuuming carpets and area rugs\nSweeping and mopping hard floors\nCleaning mirrors and windows\nRemoving trash and recycling from your home or office\nIn addition to regular cleaning services and these standard cleaning tasks, some bi-weekly cleaning services may offer additional services for an extra fee. These services may include deep cleaning of specific areas, such as the oven, refrigerator, or cabinets, laundry services, and organization of cluttered areas.\nWe'll discuss your specific cleaning needs and preferences beforehand to ensure that we tailor our services to your needs. This will help our cleaning crew ensure that you are satisfied with the results of the bi-weekly cleaning service.\nKitchen Cleaning\nProne to grease and food spills, kitchens tend to be one of the hardest rooms to keep clean. However, they are one of the most important sections of the house to maintain tidy and neat. The kitchen is the heart of the home where loved ones gather to prepare a meal, share news, and spend time together. Impress your clients with a deep clean that accentuates those surfaces. Not only will The Heiser Group's professional cleaning services thoroughly wash your flooring, we'll also ensure that each of your primary appliances convey a fresh, good-as-new aesthetic. We focus on equipment detailed cleaning and that includes the tough grime on the sinks, stovetop, oven and more.\nLiving Room Cleaning\nYour living room is the center of attention; it's great for hosting or for just relaxing after a hard day's work. New homeowners prioritize this living space. When The Heiser Group takes on a living room, we want to make your home sparkle leaving it so your buyers can feel at home, too. We will touch on everything from ceiling fans, light fixtures, surface dusting, even the fireplace too.\nBathroom Cleaning\nBathrooms are highly susceptible to mold and mildew growth, producing harmful health effects. The last thing your clients want to see is soap scum residue on the counter or stains in the toilet. When cleaning your bathroom, The Heiser Group will clean everything from your toilet to your shower in an eco-friendly manner. Our cleaning service will add the complete finishing touch to the house and won't leave you with any unwanted odors.\nBasement Cleaning\nAlthough often forgotten about, a sparkling, modern basement can be all it takes to seal the deal. With The Heiser Group's basement cleaning service, we'll give you a streak-free floor and send the debris and dust bunnies heading for the hills. If there is a potential room for an office space in the basement, it is essential to keep it clean. A client doesn't need additional convincing with an extra space like this.\n‍\nBedroom Cleaning\nDid you know that the average American spends 36 years, or nearly half of their life, in bed? Since we dedicate so much time to our bedrooms, they should look amazing. The Heiser Group will give you a room that buyers won't mind sleeping in - they will be running for the sheets.\nGarage Cleaning\nAlthough not always physically attached, the garage is an extension of your property. After The Heiser Group conducts a power washing to the flooring, your garage will feel more inviting to potential buyers. Whether they'll use it for a vehicle or storage, it shouldn't be out of sight or out of mind for a cleaning.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nGENERAL QUESTIONS\nWhat is a bi-weekly clean?\nA bi-weekly clean refers to a recurring service where cleaning tasks are performed every two weeks.

However, they are one of the most important sections of the house to maintain tidy and neat. The kitchen is the heart of the home where loved ones gather to prepare a meal, share news, and spend time together. Impress your clients with a deep clean that accentuates those surfaces. Not only will The Heiser Group's professional cleaning services thoroughly wash your flooring, we'll also ensure that each of your primary appliances convey a fresh, good-as-new aesthetic. We focus on equipment detailed cleaning and that includes the tough grime on the sinks, stovetop, oven and more.\nLiving Room Cleaning\nYour living room is the center of attention; it's great for hosting or for just relaxing after a hard day's work. New homeowners prioritize this living space. When The Heiser Group takes on a living room, we want to make your home sparkle leaving it so your buyers can feel at home, too. We will touch on everything from ceiling fans, light fixtures, surface dusting, even the fireplace too.\nBathroom Cleaning\nBathrooms are highly susceptible to mold and mildew growth, producing harmful health effects.

When cleaning your bathroom, The Heiser Group will clean everything from your toilet to your shower in an eco-friendly manner. Our cleaning service will add the complete finishing touch to the house and won't leave you with any unwanted odors.\nBasement Cleaning\nAlthough often forgotten about, a sparkling, modern basement can be all it takes to seal the deal.

If there is a potential room for an office space in the basement, it is essential to keep it clean.

Since we dedicate so much time to our bedrooms, they should look amazing. The Heiser Group will give you a room that buyers won't mind sleeping in - they will be running for the sheets.\nGarage Cleaning\nAlthough not always physically attached, the garage is an extension of your property.

With The Heiser Group's basement cleaning service, we'll give you a streak-free floor and send the debris and dust bunnies heading for the hills. If there is a potential room for an office space in the basement, it is essential to keep it clean. A client doesn't need additional convincing with an extra space like this.\n\n‍\n\n## Bedroom Cleaning\n\nDid you know that the average American spends 36 years, or nearly half of their life, in bed? Since we dedicate so much time to our bedrooms, they should look amazing. The Heiser Group will give you a room that buyers won't mind sleeping in - they will be running for the sheets.\n\n## Garage Cleaning\n\nAlthough not always physically attached, the garage is an extension of your property.

  "text": "3 Hardwood Floor Cleaning Tips for Your Home or Office\n3 Hardwood Floor Cleaning Tips for Your Home or Office\nCleaning your hardwood floor, whether it be in your home or office, is not something you want to take lightly or do without researching first.\nA well-maintained hardwood floor can last a long time, so make sure you know exactly what you need to do to take care of it. Here are some simple tips to help you clean.\n1. USE PROTECTION WHEN MOVING YOUR FURNITURE\nTo get to every square of flooring, you’ll have to move some furniture around. Hardwood floors can easily be scratched, nicked, or chipped if you do this the wrong way. The best, easiest, and cheapest way to move furniture is to use simple protection in the form of:\nSliders: These are designed to be permanently attached to the base of your furniture so, when the time comes to clean, they can be easily and safely moved.\nFelt pads: Like sliders, these are attached to your furniture and are designed to protect your floor.\nFurniture Blankets: These are the largest option that would work best for the largest, hard-to-move furniture. These work by sliding them under heavier or larger pieces of furniture and then using them to move the furniture away.\n2. VACUUM OR SWEEP BEFORE MOPPING\nBefore you set out with a mop, you’ll want to vacuum or sweep your hardwood floor to get the lighter dust and dirt and pick up any larger pieces that have settled onto it.\nWhen it comes to choosing a vacuum, be sure you buy one that is designed to work on wooden floors and provides the correct suction to be useful on a hard surface. If you’re working with multiple types of surfaces (carpets, tiles, etc.) you can buy a multi-surface vacuum.\nHowever, if you absolutely have to use a vacuum not designed for hardwood, be sure to remove the “beater bar”, which can damage the finish on the floor, and attach any brush attachments available to help kick up the dirt and grime.\n3. USE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS WHEN MOPPING HARDWOOD FLOORS\nAfter you’ve finished vacuuming or sweeping, you can use a mop to fully clean some of the higher traffic areas of your floor.\nIf using a traditional string mop, be sure to squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Using too much water can leave you in danger of having standing water, which can easily damage hardwood flooring.\nAnother option for mopping is a microfiber pad mop. Microfiber works to attract and trap dirt and grime and uses less moisture. Products like a Swiffer Wet Jet lets you spray out just as much liquid cleaner as you need.\nAs far as products go, it’s generally best to go with a cleaner designed for hardwood cleaning. These will be gentlest on your finish, produce the best shine, and clean up the messes generally found on wooden floors.\nUSE PROFESSIONAL CLEANING SERVICES\nIf you have any doubts or want to be sure your floor is cleaned in the safest, quickest, and most effective way, it’s never a bad idea to go with a professional cleaning service. This will remove any doubt that your floor is as clean as it can be and is being taken care of in the right way.\nWhether you’re prepping a home for sale or trying to make your office hardwood flooring look spick and span, The Heiser Group has got you covered.

It’s also a natural haven for the spread of bacteria and germs.\nWhether it’s in your home or your office, keeping your kitchen well-cleaned is crucial for a healthy space. Here are five tips from The Heiser Group for cleaning and sanitizing your home or office kitchen.\nIMPLEMENT CLEAR CLEANING POLICIES\nThe easiest way to enforce the tips we’ll mention in this article is to make sure everyone knows the rules and policies of your kitchen. List out what people are expected to do when using the shared kitchen area. \nThese may include:\nClean up the microwave after each use\nWipe up any spills or messes immediately\nDon’t leave old food in the fridge\nOnly use clean dishes and silverware\nIf everyone knows the rules, there’s no doubt what needs to be done, and if everyone does their part, you’ll have a cleaner and healthier kitchen space.\nKEEP CLEANING SUPPLIES STOCKED AND READILY AVAILABLE\nIf cleaning supplies like Lysol wipes, paper towels, and all-purpose cleaners are readily available, the fight to keep your kitchen clean is greatly reduced.\nThe types of cleaners varies depending on the equipment, but a good starter list would look like this:\nAll-purpose Cleaner: Something that covers all ranges of messes and is in an easily-accessed spray bottle.\nDisinfectant wipes: These are an absolute necessity. Having them within reach greatly increases the chances people will use them. A quick wipe down after using any equipment is a big step toward a clean kitchen.\nPaper towels: If you don’t have a way to clean reusable rags, having paper towels stocked is the next best thing. \nDegreaser: To keep bacteria from building up in a toaster oven or microwave, it’s important to remove the caked on residue that gets left over. A simple degreasing spray—paired with a paper towel—is the best way to make sure everything comes off when cleaning.\nBroom: Crumbs build up fast when you have so many people sharing a food preparation place. A quick sweeping everyday will keep the floors from gathering dirt, dust, and food. This is also the best way to keep pests like ants and roaches away.\nMold cleaner: It’s almost inevitable that you’ll find mold at some point in a kitchen. An all-purpose cleaner might do the trick, but using a designated anti-mold cleaner is the only way to make sure you kill off every bit.\nALWAYS CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF\nNo matter the rules or policies in place, it’s up to everyone to pitch in to keep a shared kitchen space clean and healthy. Don’t let spills sit around and harden, clean up all crumbs, and wipe down used surfaces or appliances.\nSANITIZE HIGH-ACTIVITY AREAS WITHIN YOUR KITCHEN\nThe most-touched parts of your kitchen, things that nearly everyone will come into contact with at some point, must be sanitized with disinfectant wipes as often as possible. \nAreas to clean are:\nCabinet Handles\nMicrowave Handles & Buttons\nCoffee Machines\nCounters\nFridge Handles\nToaster Ovens\nHIRE A COMMERCIAL CLEANER\nNobody can do a better job than the pros. If you have any doubts about the cleanliness of your kitchen and the safety of your staff because of it, go with the experts. \nHiring a commercial cleaning company like The Heiser Group means\nYou’ll never have to worry about forgetting to clean\nYou’ll have no doubts whether or not your kitchen is at its absolute cleanest\nYou’ll have the peace of mind of a clean working space.\nThe kitchen is a busy place and with so many liquids and foods it’s an easy location for germs to spread quickly through many people. So, make sure you’re doing everything you can to ensure everyone’s safety by keeping it as clean as possible.\nFor help with commercial cleaning, call in the home or office kitchen specialists at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

And, obviously, removing stains is much tougher.\nHere are a few tips to help your office maintain a cleaner workplace carpet.\n1. Vacuuming and basic upkeep\nWe’ll start with the most obvious which is to vacuum regularly, and have a cleaning plan in place so that it never goes too long without being cleaned.\nVacuuming is the most important factor in maintaining your carpet (and doing so will pick up ~80% of the dirt found in it.) So, you should ideally vacuum everyday but, let’s face it, nobody has time for that, so every few days should be fine.\nFor the remaining 20% of the dirt and debris not picked up by the vacuum, you’ll need to do a little deep cleaning. For this, you can call in an expert (as we will note below) or do some cleaning with basic tools like vinegar, baking soda, and a detergent.\n2. Have a Plan for Spills and Stains\nCatching a spill early is the key to preventing it from setting and affecting your carpet long term. So, firstly, you need to have the tools readily available to everyone in the office.\nMake it known where they are and how to use them. This knowledge will help people know exactly what to do and reduce the chances somebody spills and forgets.\nFor products to use, there are a huge number of readily available remedies sold in stores to help deal with hard stains and, most of the time, all you need is some product, a brush, and a vacuum, which should all be already in your office.\nIf no cleaner is available, there are seemingly infinite home remedies using other things you may find around the office like salt, vinegar, and even WD-40.\n3. When in Doubt, Go With the Pros\nIf things get out of hand or you start to notice lingering smells or stains, it might be time to call in the professionals and be sure to do everything you can to prepare the office for their arrival:\nRemove fragile and breakable items from the area waiting to be cleaned so that nothing of value is broken or lost.\nMove furniture and clear the way for the cleaners to make sure nothing hinders them from doing the job.\nFind the areas that need cleaning the heaviest to show the cleaners where to concentrate their efforts.\nIf you have a carpeted office, you may not know everything that needs to be done to keep it clean as clean as possible.

  "text": "2021 Office Cleaning Schedule Set-Up\nThere is no time like the present to establish a 2021 office cleaning schedule. While every facility wants a clean, safe, and healthy work environment, the challenge lies in its consistency.\nWhen employees already have so many responsibilities, keeping the environment clean can be a tough “ask” over time. Through three generations, The Heiser Group has experience in collaborating with facility managers to make the process a little easier.\nThe Importance of Creating a 2021 Office Cleaning Schedule\nSimilar to the New Year’s resolutions linked to frequent exercise and healthy eating, saying that we will do something is easy. The follow-through is where the challenge lies.\nCreating a commercial cleaning schedule is no different. This is why it all starts with a basic structure.\nHow to Establish a Sustainable 2021 Office Cleaning Schedule\nA lot goes into establishing a 2021 office cleaning schedule, especially one that employees will adhere to thoroughly. The Heiser Group has a few, quick tips to ease the burden.\nMAKE EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE\nThe best way to make sure everything gets cleaned is to enlist everyone to help. Assuming employees clean up their own messes and maintain an organized workspace, much of the surface-level work is already done.\nDEVELOP A ROTATING CHORES LIST\nOutside of personal space, offices should develop a rotating chores list.

  "markdown": "# 2021 Office Cleaning Schedule Set-Up\n\nThere is no time like the present to establish a 2021 office cleaning schedule. While every facility wants a clean, safe, and healthy work environment, the challenge lies in its consistency.\n\nWhen employees already have so many responsibilities, keeping the environment clean can be a tough “ask” over time. Through three generations, The Heiser Group has experience in collaborating with facility managers to make the process a little easier.\n\n## The Importance of Creating a 2021 Office Cleaning Schedule\n\nSimilar to the New Year’s resolutions linked to frequent exercise and healthy eating, saying that we will do something is easy. The follow-through is where the challenge lies.\n\nCreating a commercial cleaning schedule is no different. This is why it all starts with a basic structure.\n\n## How to Establish a Sustainable 2021 Office Cleaning Schedule\n\nA lot goes into establishing a [2021 office cleaning schedule](https://www.heisergroup.com/commercial-cleaning), especially one that employees will adhere to thoroughly. The Heiser Group has a few, quick tips to ease the burden.\n\n### MAKE EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE\n\nThe best way to make sure everything gets cleaned is to enlist everyone to help. Assuming employees clean up their own messes and maintain an organized workspace, much of the surface-level work is already done.\n\n### DEVELOP A ROTATING CHORES LIST\n\nOutside of personal space, offices should develop a rotating chores list. Under this philosophy, team members will switch off on weekly tasks.\n\nThis eliminates favoritism and office politics for ensured equality. In addition, employees will have a clear idea of their weekly responsibilities, so nothing is left unchecked.\n\n### MAKE TOOLS READILY AVAILABLE\n\nRegardless of the job, we all need the right tools to do it efficiently. To facilitate your environment’s 2021 industrial cleaning regimen, there should be a supply closet filled with the necessary tools.\n\nThese can include paper towels, sanitizer wipes, and cleaning sprays. Having these stocked in an easily available location helps employees to access them without trouble.\n\n## Consult Commercial Professionals Regarding Your 2021 Office Cleaning Schedule\n\nThe easiest way to maintain a clean, healthy office space is to bring on the help of professional commercial cleaners.

But, with the events of today, it became an absolute must.\nSo, airlines found a solution: electrostatic disinfectant spraying.\nQuick, Effective Cleaning\nElectrostatic disinfectant spraying has a lot of benefits for airlines. Firstly, it’s a quick way to perform a top-to-bottom cleaning of an aircraft that won’t get in the way of schedules and doesn’t require an immense amount of manpower to perform. Just a few spray guns, a walk down the aisle, and the electrically charged particles will find every surface and cling to them.\nThe solution can fight most tough germs, covers surfaces evenly (no need to wipe it around), and is safe to touch immediately after being used so travelers don’t have to wait long after it’s used.\nThe second main benefit, and the reason it works in the first place, is that it’s a highly effective way to disinfect large areas. The charged particles in the spray seek out and cling to surfaces which means it’s able to completely disinfect seats, arm rests, tray tables, doors, bathrooms, and galleys.\nHow Does Electrostatic Disinfectant Spray Work?\nThe disinfectant solution becomes charged when it leaves the nozzle. These charged particles then cling to surfaces—and resist each other—so they cover the most surface area. The particles not only cling but will wrap around and completely cover whatever surface it lands on.\nThis evenly and completely covers all surfaces and takes away the risk of missing surfaces that happens with manual cleaning—not to mention it takes significantly less manpower and time.\nElectrostatic Disinfectant spray has become a must-have part of every airline’s health strategy in recent months. Along with masks and general hygiene practices by crew and passengers, airlines can successfully fight the spread and sanitize their planes before departure.\nTo schedule an electrostatic disinfectant spray service for your facility, reach out to the commercial cleaning specialists at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

  "text": "Professional Carpet Shampoo & Carpet Cleaning\n‍\nWhether you need carpet shampooing for your home, office or commercial property, our team of trained technicians is ready to help you maintain a clean and healthy space. While regular vacuuming can remove surface dirt, professional carpet shampooing goes beyond the surface to penetrate deep into the fibers, eliminating tough stains, pet dander, allergens and odors.\nCarpet Cleaning Services\nThe Heiser Group implements two primary methods for specialty carpet cleaning: hot water extraction and bonnet cleaning.\nHot Water Extraction\nCommonly known as steam carpet cleaning, our hot water extraction service introduces highly pressurized hot water to agitate the carpet fibers and dissolve dirt in the carpet. This involves applying a cleaning agent, agitating the carpet fibers with a rotary brush and a final rinsing.\nBonnet Cleaning\nUnlike hot water extraction, our bonnet cleaning service focuses primarily on the carpet's surface. We apply a heavy duty motorized rotary machine into a cleaning agent, and then apply the spinning bonnet pad to the carpet fibers. This process absorbs dirt from the carpeting and is great for a rapid spot-cleaning.\nCarpet Shampooing Process\nAt The Heiser Group, our carpet shampooing process is designed to leave your carpets fresh and odor-free. While specific steps of the process may differ depending on your selected service, the end result remains the same: clean carpets.\nPre-Cleaning Inspection\nWe understand that every carpet is different, with specific cleaning requirements. That's why our carpet shampooing process begins with a comprehensive pre-cleaning inspection. Our trained technicians assess the condition of your carpet, taking note of any stains, pet accidents or high-traffic areas that require special attention. This inspection allows us to tailor our cleaning approach to your specific needs, ensuring the best results. By identifying problem areas, we can effectively treat stains, remove deep-seated dirt and restore the beauty of your carpets. Our attention to detail during the pre-cleaning inspection sets the stage for a thorough and effective carpet shampooing process that exceeds your expectations.\nStain and Spot Treatment\nOur carpet shampooing process includes specialized stain and spot treatment to target stubborn stains and blemishes. To effectively tackle stains, we use professional stain removers and natural carpet cleaner, minimizing the use of harsh chemicals. Our stain and spot treatment process includes:\nIdentification of tough stains and spots\nApplication of stain remover on problem areas\nGentle scrubbing to break down stains\nExtraction of loosened stains and residue\nThorough rinsing to remove any remaining traces of stains\nDeep Cleaning Shampoo\nAfter stain and spot treatment, our carpet shampooing process moves on to deep cleaning shampoo. We use a professional carpet cleaning machine, along with our professional strength carpet shampoo, to penetrate deep into the carpet fibers and efficiently remove embedded dirt, allergens, pet dander and odor. Our deep cleaning shampoo ensures a thorough clean, revitalizing your carpets and leaving them fresh and clean. With our expertise and state-of-the-art equipment, we guarantee that our deep cleaning shampoo delivers the best way to clean carpets.\nRinsing and Extraction\nRinsing and extraction are crucial steps in our carpet shampooing process, ensuring the removal of cleaning agents, residue and contaminants from your carpets. Our professional carpet cleaner thoroughly rinses your carpets, which eliminates any traces of shampoo and leaves them clean, fresh and residue-free. Then, the extraction process takes place, effectively removing any remaining dirt, allergens and odor to achieve a deep clean.\nFinal Inspection and Client Approval\nAt The Heiser Group, customer satisfaction is our top priority. That's why our carpet shampooing process concludes with a final inspection and client approval. Our trained technicians thoroughly inspect your carpets, ensuring that every aspect of our cleaning process has been completed successfully. We want to make sure that you are completely satisfied with our service, and we invite you to review the last test results and provide feedback. Your approval is our guarantee that our professional carpet shampooing process has met our commitment to quality.\nOur Expertise in Carpet Shampooing\nWhen you choose The Heiser Group for your carpet shampooing needs, you can trust that your carpets are in good hands.\nEfficient Tools and Techniques\nWe use top-of-the-line equipment to ensure a thorough and efficient clean. Our carpet cleaning machine is designed to effectively remove dirt, stains and odor, leaving your carpets clean and revitalized. Our efficient tools and cleaning techniques provide a deep, effective clean.\nCommitment to Quality Service\nOur commitment to quality service is at the core of everything we do. It is reflected in our professional team who is dedicated to providing the best carpet cleaning experience for our clients. It is also reflected in our use of only the best quality cleaning products and equipment, ensuring a deep clean that exceeds expectations.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nWe take pride in our work and always ensure that our clients are completely satisfied with our service. When you choose The Heiser Group, you can trust that we will deliver exceptional results, leaving your carpets looking their best.\nFlexible Schedules\nWe understand that convenience is an important factor when it comes to choosing a carpet shampooing service.

  "text": "How to Keep Your Office Clean of Coronavirus\nHow to Keep Your Office Clean of Coronavirus\nCoronavirus is spreading quickly throughout the entire world with new cases popping up daily. Fortunately, the CDC and other health organizations have provided many tips to help offices stay clean of the virus and limit its spread.\nKEEP YOUR PERSONAL AREA CLEAN\nThe first step toward a consistently clean office is to take care of your space. Here are some basic tips on maintaining a sanitized work area:\nFrequently sanitize your equipment. The equipment you use most often, such as keyboards, phones, mouse, pens and pencils, and your desk are the ones most susceptible to germs.\nKeep hand sanitizer close by. It’s worth your time to invest in a large bottle of sanitizer exclusively for yourself.\nHave tissues on your desk. Using tissues when sneezing helps trap mucus and germs from flying about. If no tissues are available, the “Dracula sneeze technique” is your best option (sneezing into the crook of your elbow).\nSANITIZE SURFACES THAT ARE FREQUENTLY TOUCHED\nIn order to halt the virus before it can begin to spread throughout your office, sanitize the surfaces that are frequently touched by everyone.\nThis includes:\nDoorknobs\nOffice equipment like printers, copiers, coffee machines, water coolers, etc.\nHandles of cabinets and drawers\nCountertops\nKitchen appliances like fridges, microwaves, toaster ovens, etc.\nThis can be as simple as wiping them down hourly with disinfectant wipes or having a container of wipes for people to use when touching these surfaces. And when nearly everyone in the office is touching these objects, sanitizing them is a smart long-term practice.\nENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WASH THEIR HANDS\nThis may sound like common sense, but actually 95% aren’t washing their hands properly.\nYour employees’ personal hygiene is one of the biggest keys to keeping coronavirus away which is why it’s important to educate and encourage people about proper handwashing techniques. According to the CDC, proper technique involves:\nRunning hands under clean water (warm or cold).\nLathering hands with soap.\nRub hands together for at least 20 seconds.\nRinse with clean water.\nDry completely.\nWhen handwashing is not something you have the ability or time to do frequently, hand sanitizer can be helpful, but be sure it contains 60-95% alcohol.\nRALLY AND INFORM YOUR TEAM\nThe fight against the virus shouldn’t be left to just one person. The most effective strategy is to enlist the help of everyone by informing those around you of best practices, providing them with the proper equipment (wipes, cleaners, paper towels, hand sanitizer, face masks, etc.), and making sure everyone does their part in keeping the office clean. As we said above, everyone needs to pull their weight, keep their things clean, and pitch in by sanitizing frequently touched surfaces.\nAlong with that, you may refrain from basic business etiquette like hand shaking for the time being.\nAlso, be sure everyone understands the basic symptoms of the virus which, according to the CDC, are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. If someone shows signs of the virus, ensure they don’t come in and risk the health of everyone else.\nIt will take your whole team to ensure the office stays as clean as possible and as safe as possible from the coronavirus. Everyone needs to be informed and everyone needs to clean. With the right strategy, the right tools, and the right mindset, you can keep yourself and your team healthy.\nBut ensuring a properly cleaned and sanitized office is time-consuming, to say the least. For those looking to permanently take this operation off their plate, call in the commercial cleaning experts at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

Summer is the busiest season for many and that means lots of dirt, grime, and dust buildup in places you do not normally reach with a weekly or daily cleaning.\nHere is a list of things to remember to help you get ready for the fall.\nFall Home Cleaning Tip #1: Remember Your Baseboards\nSummer is typically the busiest month for many with family and friends constantly coming and going. This increase in foot traffic tends to lead toward the buildup of dust and muck on the baseboards around your home. \nTo clean them off, use a dusting cloth to get the surface dust followed by a damp rag or paper towel to scrub away the grime.\nFall Home Cleaning Tip #2: Protect Your Floors from Mud\nWith fall weather comes rain, snow, and typically lots of mud which can track into your home and quickly cake on, making a difficult-to-clean mess. To prepare, there are a few things you should consider protecting the interior of your home.\nPrepare Your Entryways: You might want to consider laying down mats and rugs right inside doorways and have a place for people to place shoes, boots, etc., so they do not wear them into the home.\nMop Regularly: It is a fact of life that dirt and mud will track in at some point. So, you must mop regularly, especially near doorways, to make sure dirt does not cake on and build-up to create something difficult to remove.\nFall Home Cleaning Tip #3: Clean Windows & Screens\nBetween the bugs, pollen, and dirt of the summer months, your windows and window screens are most likely full of dirt and grime.\nFor windows, a simple store-bought cleaning mixture and some paper towels should do the trick to relieve them of the dust and grime buildup over the summer.\nTo clean your screens, the most effective way is to remove them completely and follow these steps:\nAfter removing, you will probably want to take them outside so the dust and dirt cleaned off does not build up back inside your home.\nNext, vacuum the loose dust off of them with either a handheld vacuum or a handheld attachment.\nThen, use soapy water and wipe them off with a rag or towel. After that, you can rinse them off simply with a hose or by wiping them again with clean water.\nOne more round of vacuuming to dry and pick up any looser articles from the screens.\nScreens can quickly collect all kinds of dirt over just a few months, especially after a long summer, so it is important to give them a quick cleaning in the fall.\nFall Home Cleaning Tip #4: Clean Out Chimneys and Fireplaces\nFall is the perfect time of year to hang out by the fire while the temperatures drop outside. But, before you start building a fire, make sure you have cleaned the fireplace. You need to make sure all loose soot and debris are cleared out and that you have removed and cleaned all grates and andirons.\nAfter that, you will want to scrub the walls with a hard-bristled brush to remove the soot and grime that may have built up over the months it was not in use. Be sure to cover the bottom of the fireplace with a newspaper or something to catch the falling debris.\nFall Home Cleaning Tip #5: Clear Out Your Gutters\nFall is a difficult time for the gutters on your home. With a mixture of falling leaves, rainwater, snow, hail, and freezing temperatures all possible, your gutters will be working hard. Make sure you clean them thoroughly at the beginning of the season to make sure they are in fighting shape to battle the elements and do their jobs.\nHere are a few tips to help you give them the best possible cleaning:\nUse a ‘gutter scoop’ or another small scoop to get the debris out from inside. Make sure to clear all the spaces so water can flow smoothly. \nFlush your gutters with a garden hose to clear out hidden debris and to make sure water can get through every pipe. \nLastly, do a visual inspection to make sure you do not have any loose or sagging metals. You can also take a look at any weather damage from the summer storms.\nFall is the perfect time to do a quick deep cleaning to clean out the dust and grime from summer and prepare your home for the approaching cold weather months. \nTo prepare your home for fall, get in touch with the home cleaning specialists at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

They’re efficient, effective, and—compared to the competition—the best way to disinfect a large area.\nHOW ELECTROSTATIC DISINFECTANT SPRAY COMPARES\nThere are many ways to get the disinfecting job done when looking to clean industrial areas or spaces with lots of traffic like locker rooms. Each option will do the job, if done well, but not all of them are easy or efficient. Here’s how electrostatic disinfectant spray stacks up compared to some of the top alternative cleaning methods.\nElectrostatic Disinfectant Vs. Fogging\nThough some foggers can be electrostatically charged, handling your charged spray with a handheld sprayer gives you the accuracy to ensure that all areas are hit and disinfected properly.\nA handheld sprayer gives you full control over where and how much disinfectant you apply to certain areas and leaves no mystery as to whether all the surfaces and areas were affected. \nFogging a room is a good way to hit a large area with little effort, but it does leave you potentially spotty coverage, something you don’t have to worry about with electrostatic spraying.\nElectrostatic Disinfectant Vs. Ultraviolet Light\nThough using an ultraviolet source is effective at disinfecting and can be used in a handheld fashion much like electrostatic, the real drawback comes from the price of application. The equipment can be expensive to purchase and expensive to run.\nWhile you get a solid, contactless solution, it’s also probably the most expensive one whereas using electrostatic disinfectant spraying is cheaper while still providing a huge amount of coverage with the same amount of effort.\nElectrostatic Disinfectant Vs. Manual Disinfection\nThe benefits of electrostatic disinfectants over a manual-style disinfection are abundant. Not only does using an electrostatic sprayer save you time, it is a much more efficient way at making sure every surface is effectively covered and disinfected. \nThe electrostatically charged particles involved in electrostatic disinfection wrap themselves around every surface, leaving nothing untouched and removing any risk of you accidentally forgoing an area or missing anything.\nComparing electrostatic disinfectant spray to the many other types of disinfectants just makes all the benefits even more glaring. It is an efficient, effective, and price-friendly way to disinfect any area and ensure all surfaces are treated evenly.\nFor help with commercial cleaning, get in touch with the electrostatic disinfectant spraying specialists over at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

Conducting a quick vacuuming on a weekly basis will keep the floor free of crumbs, dust, and other debris.\nDISINFECTANTS\nA well-kept supply of disinfectants is important to maintain a healthy office environment for everyone at work, especially when cold and flu season comes around. Keeping a strong supply of disinfectants allows you to promote cleanliness and sanitation in those often touched and crucial pieces of equipment like pens, pencils, keyboards, phones, and door handles.\nDisinfectants come in many shapes and forms:\nDisinfectant Wipes: A very versatile tool, wipes can be used on everything from cleaning up small spills to quickly and effectively disinfecting any surface of disease-spreading pathogens.\nHand Sanitizer: A mainstay for a healthy workforce, keeping some spare hand sanitizer around the office can keep sickness from spreading from one surface to another.\nDisinfectant Spray: Sometimes, messes consume a larger surface area. For the messes that are too big for wipes, using a spray and paper towel can quickly disinfect large areas.\nAN ALL-SURFACE CLEANER\nMesses come in all shapes and sizes so you need a cleaner with just as much versatility. Going with an all-surface cleaner will let you clean off many surfaces.\nDUSTING SUPPLIES\nOften forgotten but just as important as anything else is remembering to dust around the office. Dust can become a cocktail of bacteria, germs, dead skin, and anything else that floats around the office. Investing in a quick Swiffer can make dusting easy but be sure to check all the hard-to-reach areas like high shelves or the space above cabinets.\nMOPPING SUPPLIES\nIf your office has tile or wood flooring, you’ll want another option in floor cleaning besides the vacuum. One of the many types of mops, along with a safe cleaning solution, makes quick work of caked on messes and dirt.\nIf you’re working with hardwood at the office, make sure to go with a specific hardwood. This way, you can ensure that the finish is protected throughout consistent cleaning.\nSome messes are too big to keep under control with mere weekly cleaning around the office. For these instances, it’s more effective to call in the professionals at The Heiser Group. Get in touch with the commercial cleaning specialists today for a complimentary estimate.\n‍",

Learning everything about electrostatic disinfectant cleaners and why this new advancement is such an effective tool is the key to maintaining a healthy and productive office environment.\nWHAT EXACTLY DOES “ELECTROSTATIC” MEAN?\nThe classic, tried-and-true style of disinfecting usually means a rag and some sprays but—unless you are constantly cleaning your supplies—that usually just ends up spreading the germs and bacteria around.\nWith electrostatic disinfectants, you’re using a specialized solution—combined with air and atomized by an electrode inside the sprayer. Thanks to the combination of the solution and sprayer, the spray contains positively charged particles that are able to stick to and coat any surfaces and objects. This provides better coverage of large surfaces and a strong disinfectant solution.\nWHY IT IS AN EFFECTIVE CLEANING SOLUTION\nElectrostatic spray is—as the name suggests—electrically charged. This means that the appropriate sanitizers and disinfectants can fully wrap surfaces and completely clean them. No area is left untouched. Normal cleaners like sprays, wipes, and rags will spread germs around and it is easy to miss spots within, on top, or behind surfaces—where bacteria hides.\nIt is an efficient way to clean, also. Surfaces that are already covered will repel the spray.\nHOW CAN ELECTROSTATIC SPRAY HOW YOUR BUSINESS?\nIf your business is home to large rooms that are highly-susceptible to germs and bacteria—such as research and development facilities, locker rooms, etc.— then an electrostatic spray disinfectant is the perfect solution to ensure each and every crevice is cleaned and safe.\nElectrostatic cleaners simplify cleaning surfaces plagued by germs and bacteria. This technology is an innovative way to fight infections, viruses, and other fast-spreading and harmful things that lurk around us. \nFor commercial cleaning assistance, get in touch with the electrostatic disinfectant specialists at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

On average, carpets typically take around 4–6 hours to dry completely.\n\n‍\n\nWhat do professionals use to clean carpets?\n\nProfessionals use a combination of powerful carpet cleaning machines and specially formulated cleaning solutions. These machines work by injecting hot water and cleaning solution into the carpet fibers, agitating them to loosen dirt and stains. The machines then extract the dirty water, leaving your carpets fresh and clean. Professionals may also use a spot treatment for a tough stain, such as a pet stain, and high-powered extraction tools for thorough rinsing.\n\n‍\n\n## Still have questions?\n\nContact The Heiser Group today!\n\n[Contact](https://www.heisergroup.com/contact)",

Each product is given a grade from A-F that represents how it affects human and environmental health in its daily usage and production.\nFollowing their guidelines, it’s important to pick products that not only use safe, non-toxic chemicals, but also won’t harm the environment when disposed of.\nUse Non-Toxic Chemicals When Cleaning\nMost of your day-to-day, well-known cleaners make use of very toxic chemicals because they’re cheaper and/or easier to produce. The products that the EWG recommends consumers to buy in their place were created using safer ingredients, such as vinegar and other natural oils.\nIn general, chemicals to watch out for when cleaning your standard workspace include:\nCarcinogens\nEndocrine Disruptors\nNeurotoxins\nAmmonia and Chlorine Bleach\nWhile there are more to watch out for, but these are some of the most common ones you’ll find in store-bought cleaners.\nSafe Chemical Disposal\nWhether you’ve just finished cleaning or are disposing of your old, harmful chemicals, make sure you do it in ways that won’t harm the environment around you.\nGenerally, there are two quick steps you can take:\nREAD THE LABEL\nMost products will provide a toll-free number to call that will give you accurate information on how to properly dispose of that product or its container. Some will simply be thrown away, whereas others must be taken to certain facilities or recycled in specialized ways.\nDILUTE WITH WATER\nIf a product mixes with water, dilute it with running water and dispose of it down the drain. This greatly reduces the overall impact of the cleaning agent.\nUse Natural Air Cleaners\nYou may not even think about what you’re doing to your office’s air when looking to freshen it up. Simple things like a stinky spill or somebody’s lingering lunch lead many to reach for that Air Wick and spray it everywhere.\nBut think twice about that. The quality of your office’s air is extremely important and using poor products can have negative health benefits.\nAccording to the EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning, Air Wick (and many other air fresheners) have wholeheartedly earned an “F” grade when it comes to environmental friendliness. This rating takes into consideration the chemicals in the product, its effect on the environment, its sustainability in production, and any negative health effects.\nInstead, look to use great, sustainable products that work hard to earn an A grade. This makes for better quality air in the office which has many health benefits like decreasing the risk of illness and increasing comfort and productivity in your workforce.\nUsing natural cleaners will result in the same clean office that more harmful products deliver, but with the added benefit of creating a healthier environment, both in the environment and within your workforce.\nWhile these tips will give a head start to any office employee when it comes to promoting an eco-friendly environment, sometimes you need more of a heavy duty approach. When that time comes, call in the experts at The Heiser Group.\n‍",

  "text": "5 Tips to Keep a Clean and Healthy Office Environment\n5 Tips to Keep a Clean and Healthy Office Environment\nIn the workplace, we are all constantly looking for ways to increase productivity and promote a healthy environment for employees, clients, and business partners. As they say: cleanliness is next to godliness.\nA clean work environment helps you stay organized, work efficiently, and provides a healthy place where you and your coworkers can feel comfortable every day. In fact, a clean workplace can result in a 2-8% increase in productivity.\nFor help with achieving better productivity, The Heiser Group has 5 tips to help you keep a clean and healthy office environment:\n1. Disinfect Everyday\nIn the workplace, germs build up quickly thanks to many shared tools and surfaces, along with the trading of papers and supplies between many people. This makes it extremely easy for one sick person to pass along germs and quickly lead to a room full of sick people.\nThings like refrigerator doors, microwaves, vending machines, copiers, prints, water fountains, staplers and other office supplies, and the many surfaces in the bathroom are the most common places where germs are spread.\nBesides constantly washing your hands with soap and water, an easy, quick remedy is to disinfect consistently by keeping a bottle of basic hand sanitizer at your desk. In addition, a container of disinfectant wipes will let you quickly clean hard surfaces, along with anything else you touch in the office.\n2. Clean Your Carpets and Floors Regularly\nWith the many small office supplies (like staples and paper clips) moving around, the floor tends to be the place with the most debris buildup. If you prefer to eat your lunch or snacks at your desk, then this is especially true for the crumbs and spills that call the floor under your desk, “home”.\nFor carpets, there are a multitude of different cleaning strategiesdepending on what the stain or mess you’re trying to clean up. When it comes to basic crumbs and fallen litter, keeping a small vacuum around your desk will do the trick. For stains or lingering smells from uncleaned messes of the past, a small spot cleaner may be the way to go. To maintain fresh carpet upkeep, do both of these things regularly.\nOn the other hand, vacuuming can work just as well with hard floors, such as wood and tile. Depending on the type of floor you have, different chemicals and cleaning techniqueswill work to disinfect, clean, and brighten up a workspace.\nIf the job exists beyond the realm of just your desk, it may be time to look into professional help.\n3. Minimize Clutter\nThe best way to keep a well-maintained desktop is to minimize the clutter from desk decorations, gadgets, and paper.\nWhile a touch of personality from decorations and small toys is a great way to liven up your workspace, too much can make it difficult to clean dust build-up and misplaced supplies.\n4. Go Digital\nGoing fully digital with your files and documents is a great way to reduce clutter, reduce your imprint on the environment, and create a stress-free work environment for both your colleagues and yourself. Start scanning important documents to keep on your computer, work through word processors like Google Docsand Microsoft Word, and rely on apps like PandaDoc to keep track of your most important documents.\nIf paperless is not an option, look into the different organizers to maintain a physical inbox system for your desk, while keeping the majority of your desktop as clear as possible.\n5. Schedule a Time for Cleaning\nThe easiest way to develop a habit is by doing it consistently and continuously. In order to get the most out of your workspace, schedule a block of time every day, every week, or every month, exclusively dedicated to tidying up. And it doesn’t have to be boring, use different incentives and methods like rewards for the cleanliest workspace, cleaning competitions, or make your dedicated deep-cleaning day an office-wide event.\nIn order to make this day successful, make it as easy as possible for the office to clean their spaces by providing many waste bins throughout, have an abundance of available cleaning supplies, and thoroughly communicate to the team that it is time to clean.\nGO WITH THE PROFESSIONALS\nSometimes you need to call on the experts. If a job gets out of the scope of routine cleaning, go with the pros at The Heiser Group and let us give you the clean, stress-free work environment you need to keep your company at your best.\nTo take the first step towards a sparkling clean office environment, send us a message at HeiserGroup.com.\n‍",

  "text": "The 3 Most Common Carpet Stains in Your Home and How to Fix Them\nThe 3 Most Common Carpet Stains in Your Home and How to Fix Them\nCarpet stains at home are a fact of life. The more you try to avoid them, the more often they’ll come. So, it’s best to accept them as a constant and be prepared for the worst.\nThese are the 3 most common carpet stains you’ll come across at home and some ways you can treat each and every one.\nHow to Cure a Wine Stain\nProbably the most common stain talked about on TV and in movies, the dreaded red wine stain has haunted homes for years. So, how can you get it out?\nIf it’s spilled on a carpet or a shirt, then you’re in luck. The easiest answer is to toss it into a washing machine with warm water after applying a stain remover.\nIf not, things get a little trickier.\nFirst, blot (don’t rub) the stain and soak up as much of the moisture as you can.\nSecond, sprinkle an absorbent like salt or baking soda onto the spot and wait a few minutes. These will soak up even more of the liquid and will dive deep into the carpet.\nLast, pour some hot water onto the spot and continue to repeat steps one and two until the stain is gone!\nGetting Blood Out of Your Carpet\nIt may not seem so, but blood stains are extremely common in the home. Just from simple cuts to bloody noses, odds are, you’ll run into this problem from time to time.\nBlood can be a little trickier to get out of your carpet. So, the methods get more intense than dealing with red wine.\nHere are the steps:\nMix some liquid dishwashing detergent (about a tablespoon’s worth) with two cups of water.\nUsing your new solution in tandem with a clean sponge, dab the spot until the sponge has soaked up all the blood in the carpet. If the blood has already set, you may need to scrub it with a brush to remove the hardened spots.\nIf the spot remains stained, simply repeat the process until the stain is gone.\nRemove the Stain and Smell of Urine\nMany of us have pets. Unfortunately, they don’t always behave how we’d like them to.\nUrine stains are a two-part monster. Not only can the urine stain your carpet, the scent can linger for much longer.

So, how can you get it out?\n\nIf it’s spilled on a carpet or a shirt, then you’re in luck. The easiest answer is to toss it into a washing machine with warm water after applying a stain remover.\n\nIf not, things get [a little trickier](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realsimple.com%2Fhome-organizing%2Fcleaning%2Fcleaning-stain-removal%2Fremove-red-wine-stain%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0vutA9kQCd958Yso5LzAg_gikTd6Wj2_IA222dERiv1wOOqztn-aZuUeY&h=AT12DzFBgvHLBgEs5WiQ7qsRdvdhiOxxCLYEZ9f7JLQuyQJXbN_x_xFdWQ7vMKmQ8yRa_FEmPffIgArL-wJX5oNY-zyOuyitVU2l7LV21dXTAtcx2sNyQAMyrNvxQEPgojRH1w).\n\n1.  First, blot (don’t rub) the stain and soak up as much of the moisture as you can.\n2.  Second, sprinkle an absorbent like salt or baking soda onto the spot and wait a few minutes. These will soak up even more of the liquid and will dive deep into the carpet.\n3.  Last, pour some hot water onto the spot and continue to repeat steps one and two until the stain is gone!\n\n## Getting Blood Out of Your Carpet\n\nIt may not seem so, but blood stains are extremely common in the home.
