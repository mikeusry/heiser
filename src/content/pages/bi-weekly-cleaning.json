This will help our cleaning crew ensure that you are satisfied with the results of the bi-weekly cleaning service.\n\n![Real Estate Cleaning](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b80a86a8a100622af4963a/62f1747f0b52a61aa5f61139_Real_Estate_Cleaning_2.webp)\n\n## Kitchen Cleaning\n\nProne to grease and food spills, kitchens tend to be one of the hardest rooms to keep clean. However, they are one of the most important sections of the house to maintain tidy and neat. The kitchen is the heart of the home where loved ones gather to prepare a meal, share news, and spend time together. Impress your clients with a deep clean that accentuates those surfaces. Not only will The Heiser Group's professional cleaning services thoroughly wash your flooring, we'll also ensure that each of your primary appliances convey a fresh, good-as-new aesthetic. We focus on equipment detailed cleaning and that includes the tough grime on the sinks, stovetop, oven and more.\n\n## Living Room Cleaning\n\nYour living room is the center of attention; it's great for hosting or for just relaxing after a hard day's work. New homeowners prioritize this living space. When The Heiser Group takes on a living room, we want to make your home sparkle leaving it so your buyers can feel at home, too. We will touch on everything from ceiling fans, light fixtures, surface dusting, even the fireplace too.\n\n![Real Estate Cleaning](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b80a86a8a100622af4963a/62f1748037f05d5815fb196a_Real_Estate_Cleaning_5.webp)\n\n## Bathroom Cleaning\n\nBathrooms are highly susceptible to mold and mildew growth, producing harmful health effects. The last thing your clients want to see is soap scum residue on the counter or stains in the toilet. When cleaning your bathroom, The Heiser Group will clean everything from your toilet to your shower in an eco-friendly manner. Our cleaning service will add the complete finishing touch to the house and won't leave you with any unwanted odors.\n\n## Basement Cleaning\n\nAlthough often forgotten about, a sparkling, modern basement can be all it takes to seal the deal. With The Heiser Group's basement cleaning service, we'll give you a streak-free floor and send the debris and dust bunnies heading for the hills. If there is a potential room for an office space in the basement, it is essential to keep it clean. A client doesn't need additional convincing with an extra space like this.\n\n‍\n\n## Bedroom Cleaning\n\nDid you know that the average American spends 36 years, or nearly half of their life, in bed? Since we dedicate so much time to our bedrooms, they should look amazing. The Heiser Group will give you a room that buyers won't mind sleeping in - they will be running for the sheets.\n\n## Garage Cleaning\n\nAlthough not always physically attached, the garage is an extension of your property. After The Heiser Group conducts a power washing to the flooring, your garage will feel more inviting to potential buyers. Whether they'll use it for a vehicle or storage, it shouldn't be out of sight or out of mind for a cleaning.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGENERAL QUESTIONS\n\n### What is a bi-weekly clean?\n\nA bi-weekly clean refers to a recurring service where cleaning tasks are performed every two weeks.
