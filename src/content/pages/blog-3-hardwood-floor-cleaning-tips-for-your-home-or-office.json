Here are some simple tips to help you clean.\n\n## 1\\. USE PROTECTION WHEN MOVING YOUR FURNITURE\n\nTo get to every square of flooring, you’ll have to move some furniture around. Hardwood floors can easily be scratched, nicked, or chipped if you do this the wrong way. The best, easiest, and cheapest way to move furniture is to use simple protection in the form of:\n\n*   **Sliders:** These are designed to be permanently attached to the base of your furniture so, when the time comes to clean, they can be easily and safely moved.\n*   **Felt pads:** Like sliders, these are attached to your furniture and are designed to protect your floor.\n*   **Furniture Blankets:** These are the largest option that would work best for the largest, hard-to-move furniture. These work by sliding them under heavier or larger pieces of furniture and then using them to move the furniture away.\n\n## 2\\. VACUUM OR SWEEP BEFORE MOPPING\n\nBefore you set out with a mop, you’ll want to vacuum or sweep your hardwood floor to get the lighter dust and dirt and pick up any larger pieces that have settled onto it.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a vacuum, be sure you buy one that is designed to work on wooden floors and provides the correct suction to be useful on a hard surface. If you’re working with multiple types of surfaces (carpets, tiles, etc.) you can buy a multi-surface vacuum.\n\nHowever, if you absolutely have to use a vacuum not designed for hardwood, [be sure to remove the “beater bar”](https://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/maintenance-and-repair/cleaning/how-to-clean-hardwood-floors), which can damage the finish on the floor, and attach any brush attachments available to help kick up the dirt and grime.\n\n## 3\\. USE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS WHEN MOPPING HARDWOOD FLOORS\n\nAfter you’ve finished vacuuming or sweeping, you can use a mop to fully clean some of the higher traffic areas of your floor.\n\nIf using [a traditional string mop](https://mopcenter.net/10-types-of-mops-for-your-home-floor-cleaning/), be sure to squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Using too much water can [leave you in danger of having standing water](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-clean-hardwood-floors/9ba683603be9fa5395fab9003d4dbd3), which can easily damage hardwood flooring.\n\nAnother option for mopping is a microfiber pad mop. Microfiber works to attract and trap dirt and grime and uses less moisture. Products like a [Swiffer Wet Jet](https://swiffer.com/en-us/shop-products/mopping/swiffer-wetjet-mop-starter-kit) lets you spray out just as much liquid cleaner as you need.\n\nAs far as products go, it’s generally best to go with a cleaner designed for hardwood cleaning.
