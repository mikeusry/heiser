It’s also a natural haven for the  spread of bacteria and germs.\n\nWhether it’s in your home or your office, keeping your kitchen well-cleaned is crucial for a healthy space. Here are five tips from The Heiser Group for cleaning and sanitizing your home or office kitchen.\n\n## IMPLEMENT CLEAR CLEANING POLICIES\n\nThe easiest way to enforce the tips we’ll mention in this article is to make sure everyone knows the rules and policies of your kitchen. List out what people are expected to do when using the shared kitchen area.\n\nThese may include:\n\n*   Clean up the microwave after each use\n*   Wipe up any spills or messes immediately\n*   Don’t leave old food in the fridge\n*   Only use clean dishes and silverware\n\n[If everyone knows the rules, there’s no doubt what needs to be done](https://commercialcleaningcorp.com/4-tips-disinfect-dirtiest-shared-spaces-office/), and if everyone does their part, you’ll have a cleaner and healthier kitchen space.\n\n## KEEP CLEANING SUPPLIES STOCKED AND READILY AVAILABLE\n\nIf cleaning supplies like Lysol wipes, paper towels, and all-purpose cleaners are readily available, the fight to keep your kitchen clean is greatly reduced.\n\nThe types of cleaners varies depending on the equipment, but a good starter list would look like this:\n\n*   **All-purpose Cleaner:** Something that covers all ranges of messes and is in an easily-accessed spray bottle.\n*   **Disinfectant wipes:** These are an absolute necessity. Having them within reach greatly increases the chances people will use them. A quick wipe down after using any equipment is a big step toward a clean kitchen.\n*   **Paper towels:** If you don’t have a way to clean reusable rags, having paper towels stocked is the next best thing.\n*   **Degreaser:** To keep bacteria from building up in a toaster oven or microwave, it’s important to remove the caked on residue that gets left over. A simple degreasing spray—paired with a paper towel—is the best way to make sure everything comes off when cleaning.\n*   **Broom:** Crumbs build up fast when you have so many people sharing a food preparation place. A quick sweeping everyday will keep the floors from gathering dirt, dust, and food. This is also the best way to keep pests like ants and roaches away.\n*   **Mold cleaner:** It’s almost inevitable that you’ll find mold at some point in a kitchen. An all-purpose cleaner might do the trick, but using a designated anti-mold cleaner is the only way to make sure you kill off every bit.\n\n## ALWAYS CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF\n\nNo matter the rules or policies in place, it’s up to everyone to pitch in to keep a shared kitchen space clean and healthy. Don’t let spills sit around and harden, clean up all crumbs, and wipe down used surfaces or appliances.\n\n## SANITIZE HIGH-ACTIVITY AREAS WITHIN YOUR KITCHEN\n\nThe most-touched parts of your kitchen, things that nearly everyone will come into contact with at some point, [must be sanitized with disinfectant wipes as often as possible](https://www.today.com/home/surprising-spots-germs-your-office-how-clean-them-t105923).\n\n[Areas to clean are](https://www.self.com/story/germy-office-cleaning-tips)**:**\n\n*   Cabinet Handles\n*   Microwave Handles & Buttons\n*   Coffee Machines\n*   Counters\n*   Fridge Handles\n*   Toaster Ovens\n\n## HIRE A COMMERCIAL CLEANER\n\n[Nobody can do a better job than the pros](https://kitchenerclean.com/office-cleaning-services-blog/2018/4/15/office-cleaning-top-7-tips-to-keep-your-office-kitchen-clean).
