Disinfect Everyday\n\nIn the workplace, germs build up quickly thanks to many shared tools and surfaces, along with the trading of papers and supplies between many people. This makes it extremely easy for one sick person to pass along germs and quickly lead to a room full of sick people.\n\nThings like refrigerator doors, microwaves, vending machines, copiers, prints, water fountains, staplers and other office supplies, and the many surfaces in the bathroom are the most common places where germs are spread.\n\nBesides constantly washing your hands with soap and water, an easy, quick remedy is to [disinfect consistently](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quill.com%2Fblog%2Ftutorials%2Fhow-to-disinfect-your-office-space-during-flu-season.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1ud-HTpo7C7jaGEYgRxCEYo6UMHpGJPqXEd-153_P-S71mOvajYbou0gM&h=AT062iCUQ3OCy9mDMUD-CTSWGn3V-vv39eQ9hKkyG84E_fvb6ykuh9c5VKNOhDXOMFUwDVjBwY-Ye-p3jUPKpdI23jqMJIlCrm3QEQ0HfTLEZXBwm_iKE4uLefEJ7xlqlbf_UQ) by [keeping a bottle of basic hand sanitizer at your desk](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html?fbclid=IwAR14q6c8JOAQhlG0JlIXDg0aaWqzfD0XcoXNVc3JHsDs1hn6MF1pvs96xkY). In addition, a container of disinfectant wipes will let you quickly clean hard surfaces, along with anything else you touch in the office.\n\n## 2\\. Clean Your Carpets and Floors Regularly\n\nWith the many small office supplies (like staples and paper clips) moving around, the floor tends to be the place with the most debris buildup. If you prefer to eat your lunch or snacks at your desk, then this is especially true for the crumbs and spills that call the floor under your desk, “home”.\n\nFor **carpets**, there are [a multitude of different cleaning strategies](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realsimple.com%2Fhome-organizing%2Fcleaning%2Fcleaning-stain-removal%2Feasy-carpet-stain-solutions%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3YRG244N32RiT21t4Gz8gSG0OuRzyxLUrBGxa8ur8OZI7EpOkDMm9n3nw&h=AT1s_uvsHjPSshU0r1CscouzSOb68BmFE7AsNfna4Sc1QzJ7sNxewmGADF2Xi2n2kZDQkce48vH1WcASOJ8xFWtPbu6QL0Mw_-yeB17cPj0EYqDP9Iw6r-_kp3km9D_sN_00fw)depending on what the stain or mess you’re trying to clean up. When it comes to basic crumbs and fallen litter, keeping a small vacuum around your desk will do the trick. For stains or lingering smells from uncleaned messes of the past, a small spot cleaner may be the way to go. To maintain fresh carpet upkeep, do both of these things regularly.\n\nOn the other hand, vacuuming can work just as well with **hard floors**, such as wood and tile. Depending on the type of floor you have, [different chemicals and cleaning techniques](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realsimple.com%2Fhome-organizing%2Fcleaning%2Ftricks-to-clean-any-type-of-floor%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR16S9K0HXcQv9Xj1toJtOrDjaEtKcxjbCHRuAdpcMVUDFo3I1EBdobKls8&h=AT1I2POvxmno_pJeqa71amVtYn6wuL71qxZYYzI0VlE7wy3dDkaYnN8_4xMcuht6KLwRGK3t5OUnCzosM7LcmJTYEgdh-Xvk6XeT_bcniw7VD2f1EJM4jUZ_Zj9dTi4PKy6gGg)will work to disinfect, clean, and brighten up a workspace.\n\nIf the job exists beyond the realm of just your desk, it may be time to look into professional help.\n\n## 3\\. Minimize Clutter\n\nThe best way to keep a well-maintained desktop is to [minimize the clutter from desk](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.becomingminimalist.com%2Fhow-to-keep-your-desk-clear%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3V7IKG-BXcJKFyFpuUTWM2iENZ6co3E5Fzrj2AszuU8DSHpShlijp9e-s&h=AT09p0DYhF39Ma0mHP3cuuv9U43guWIz98sNBkpAEqvj8UyDTFche1eU2P-0QL0s_E02JPBL2zaGSMC3H_HV5s8nq9S0M65PXUqnOfp4ATInWqCDXD9tPPMR3zfRme9-xlukXg) decorations, gadgets, and paper.\n\nWhile a touch of personality from decorations and small toys is a great way to liven up your workspace, too much can make it difficult to clean dust build-up and misplaced supplies.\n\n## 4\\. Go Digital\n\nGoing fully digital with your files and documents is a great way to reduce clutter, reduce your imprint on the environment, and [create a stress-free work environment](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fopenworksweb.com%2F10-ways-a-clean-office-improves-productivity%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2HsTiyqBIjlBfcbH023r76hb9rM1ogq7m74i-hOPqMoexpS4xWJzlh9qE&h=AT0hXArhjgbuQdTCeihgvP3RnLLYnxDpenr08j4OUMOkPl4aBBRtDHwJF7WVmhyaB04u0snDgz7G9SU9i0iHzs84WWEuXF2252l9Eu2MMtNfZFKJL52Fo5SHB7esiEPOIxsAKw) for both your colleagues and yourself.
