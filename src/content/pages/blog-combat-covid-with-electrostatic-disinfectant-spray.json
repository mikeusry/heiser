  "markdown": "# Combat COVID with Electrostatic Disinfectant Spray\n\n## Combat COVID with Electrostatic Disinfectant Spray\n\nAs businesses look for ways to stay open during the pandemic, many have begun using electrostatic disinfectant spray to combat COVID, clean facilities, and ensure the safety of their guests and customers.\n\nHere are a few of the industries taking advantage of this breakthrough in cleaning technology.\n\n## 1\\. Gyms and Athletic Clubs\n\nGyms and athletic clubs have struggled to find efficient solutions to providing a safe place to work out. In a place where bodily fluids are abundant, they could not rely on customers cleaning machines and hand washing locker rooms and showers.\n\nSo, they turned to electrostatic disinfectant spray because it is the quickest way to cover a lot of ground. Suddenly cleaning an entire locker room was fast and incredibly efficient. Thanks to its quick drying nature and its ability to cling to surfaces, cleaning machines became much easier and much more effective.\n\n## 2\\. Airlines\n\nWith hundreds of customers going in, out, and around an airplane every few hours, finding a cleaning solution for airlines was a necessity—especially with the small amount of time between flights and trying to keep people from waiting a long time between flights.\n\nElectrostatic disinfectant spray allows for one quick and clean sweep of a plane that finds every nook and cranny of a seat and fold-out tray while drying quickly enough to allow the next batch of passengers to board without waiting.\n\n## 3\\. Schools\n\nSchools see a lot of traffic every day from the students, teachers, faculty, and visitors. And they also have a huge number of public facilities to clean. This means that there just is not time to hand wash every single one each day. With locker rooms, bathrooms, classrooms, hallways, cafeterias, gyms, and offices, they needed a quicker answer.\n\nElectrostatic disinfectant spray was the solution, allowing school cleaners to cover more ground quicker, not to mention a better, full coverage cleaning.\n\n## 4\\. Business and Office Buildings\n\nWhile many of us continue to work from home, there are just as many who simply do not have that option and office buildings have had to find a way to ensure their health and safety. Many of these buildings have turned to electrostatic disinfectants to clean bathrooms, elevators, and common areas.\n\nThey can do this because of how much time electrostatic disinfectant saves and how quickly it goes into effect.\n\n## 5\\. Entertainment\n\nEntertainment companies from all angles—movie theaters, theme parks, arcades, sports clubs—desperately searched for an effective way to clean their massive facilities. Electrostatic disinfectant allowed them not only the ability to clean a room as big as an IMAX theater, but also allowed them to finally re-open.\n\nElectrostatic Disinfectant Spray has become a mainstay in a huge variety of industries because of all the benefits it provides to cleaning large areas quickly and effectively.\n\nTo learn more about Electrostatic Disinfectant Spray, [**get in touch with the commercial cleaning specialists at The Heiser Group.**](https://www.heisergroup.com/specialty-cleaning)\n\n‍",
