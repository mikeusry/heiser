Cleaning is a surefire way to make sure they’re able to see the house for its best features and show that it’s a well-maintained property.\n\n## LET YOUR HOME BUYERS VIEW IT AS THEIR OWN\n\nOne of the most important parts of selling is to allow your potential buyers to picture the home as their own. That means you need to provide them with a blank canvas so they can imagine their own things, their own family when they walk through.\n\nDeep cleaning a home before listing and touring it is the best way to do that.
