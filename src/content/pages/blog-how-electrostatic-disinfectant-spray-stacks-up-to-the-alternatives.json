They’re efficient, effective, and—[compared to the competition](https://www.cleanroomtechnology.com/news/article_page/Cleaning_and_Disinfection_Whole_room_fogging/52850)—the best way to disinfect a large area.\n\n## HOW ELECTROSTATIC DISINFECTANT SPRAY COMPARES\n\nThere are many ways to get the disinfecting job done when looking to clean industrial areas or spaces with lots of traffic like locker rooms. Each option will do the job, if done well, but not all of them are easy or efficient. Here’s how electrostatic disinfectant spray stacks up compared to some of the top alternative cleaning methods.\n\n## Electrostatic Disinfectant Vs. Fogging\n\nThough some foggers can be electrostatically charged, handling your charged spray with a handheld sprayer gives you the accuracy to ensure that all areas are hit and disinfected properly.\n\nA handheld sprayer gives you full control over where and how much disinfectant you apply to certain areas and leaves no mystery as to whether all the surfaces and areas were affected.\n\nFogging a room is a good way to hit a large area with little effort, but it does leave you [potentially spotty coverage](https://efsclean.com/uncategorized/electrostatic-disinfecting-versus-fogging-whats-the-difference/), something you don’t have to worry about with electrostatic spraying.\n\n## Electrostatic Disinfectant Vs. Ultraviolet Light\n\nThough using an ultraviolet source is effective at disinfecting and can be used in a handheld fashion much like electrostatic, the real drawback comes from the price of application. The equipment can be expensive to purchase and expensive to run.\n\nWhile you get a solid, contactless solution, it’s also [probably the most expensive](https://www.core77.com/posts/96010/The-Benefits-and-Drawbacks-of-Disinfecting-Surfaces-and-Killing-COVID-19-with-UV-Lights) one whereas using electrostatic disinfectant spraying is cheaper while still providing a huge amount of coverage with the same amount of effort.\n\n## Electrostatic Disinfectant Vs. Manual Disinfection\n\nThe benefits of electrostatic disinfectants over a manual-style disinfection are abundant. Not only does using an electrostatic sprayer save you time, it is a much more efficient way at making sure every surface is effectively covered and disinfected.\n\nThe electrostatically charged particles involved in electrostatic disinfection wrap themselves around every surface, leaving nothing untouched and removing any risk of you accidentally forgoing an area or missing anything.\n\nComparing electrostatic disinfectant spray to the many other types of disinfectants just makes all the benefits even more glaring. It is an efficient, effective, and price-friendly way to disinfect any area and ensure all surfaces are treated evenly.\n\nFor help with commercial cleaning, [get in touch with the electrostatic disinfectant spraying specialists over at The Heiser Group.](https://www.heisergroup.com/contact)\n\n‍",
