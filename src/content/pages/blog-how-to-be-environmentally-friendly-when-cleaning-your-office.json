Each product is given a grade from A-F that represents how it affects human and environmental health in its daily usage and production.\n\nFollowing their guidelines, it’s important to pick products that not only use safe, non-toxic chemicals, but also won’t harm the environment when disposed of.\n\n## Use Non-Toxic Chemicals When Cleaning\n\nMost of your day-to-day, well-known cleaners [make use of very toxic chemicals](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.groovygreen.com%2F5-tips-for-eco-friendly-office-cleaning%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2Z_EyATRKoDjR4jSv5m97QaT2906ncL2wRovwW3JC1-5Qtu3kKTajmjKY&h=AT1Nlj4puCqWd6qieN92vSBhTQso4dqPwFZ6QYmurfwWeGqhH3P0lkFRLDYAj6RkHNtjzP8aOVHG6_8QnTImm1wdR6pUVf4xwclJ2Ix-iAiltpa9IB-yes-pKKbUkzPSc58HxQ) because they’re cheaper and/or easier to produce. The products that the EWG recommends consumers to buy in their place were created using safer ingredients, such as vinegar and other natural oils.\n\nIn general, [chemicals to watch out for](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ewg.org%2Fhealthyhomeguide%2Fcleaners-and-air-fresheners%2F%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw2K3rBRDiARIsAOFSW_52bEEFDWkC_J5BNzfG1_Dfm6Y9PBJt60J7Y4x6Xhbl_xzDyWu3bV0aAtcqEALw_wcB%26fbclid%3DIwAR0vfFDWiZ2U9_mdugC40heFZVAxPsXXpEz2n7hM6xAqEMzaMGljrvxO4lQ&h=AT0CXPm-fTH7UmXncUaxVDCz2y9Byjsv05np9hmErYIYelw8BTYjjqLgBV5jK2K_YD9G9XyMrondbPJV6PORARx8RVuBpl3k94mSFcPA22ncmpljquQ7Vu7CxJ_tK8hvfvU4Ww) when cleaning your standard workspace include:\n\n*   Carcinogens\n*   Endocrine Disruptors\n*   Neurotoxins\n*   Ammonia and Chlorine Bleach\n\nWhile there are more to watch out for, but these are some of the most common ones you’ll find in store-bought cleaners.\n\n## Safe Chemical Disposal\n\nWhether you’ve just finished cleaning or are disposing of your old, harmful chemicals, make sure you do it in ways that won’t harm the environment around you.\n\nGenerally, there are two quick steps you can take:\n\n### **READ THE LABEL**\n\nMost products [will provide a toll-free number](https://earth911.com/inspire/programs-initiatives/safely-dispose-cleaning-products/?fbclid=IwAR1ZUlOAJPr5yRa_2m_s1V3CZB8TJRru5-SzTbEwWjNoqH5Mvm4uKj3oato) to call that will give you accurate information on how to properly dispose of that product or its container. [Some will simply be thrown away](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fearth911.com%2Fearth-watch%2Fcheat-sheet-biodegradable%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2jUt634y1lN6Imcg-zl4SHuvROdDiU7nOoGNdjgbL7OBEixCFdb-cK5Vw&h=AT1q9EWjfGps8D3mZd7xtPtdz7aJA2_T-5T3l7TlchyBmho8N4nTJUxKAoeVVSs56ttT1mPszzO1yBVV3vHpU3b5QPDxxXbbfa_sXslYM4Xe6EYbge2uXtMpa-i-TUURmMN8cA), whereas others must be taken to certain facilities or recycled in specialized ways.\n\n### **DILUTE WITH WATER**\n\nIf a product mixes with water, dilute it with running water and dispose of it down the drain. This greatly reduces the overall impact of the cleaning agent.\n\n## Use Natural Air Cleaners\n\nYou may not even think about what you’re doing to your office’s air when looking to freshen it up. Simple things like a stinky spill or somebody’s lingering lunch lead many to reach for that Air Wick and spray it everywhere.\n\nBut think twice about that. [The quality of your office’s air is extremely important](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Findoor-air-quality-iaq%2Foffice-building-occupants-guide-indoor-air-quality%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1EeKWYp4Q2Zd2SdhEfkeFkzlI2Lnm8yFqCv-bl2IlzkjLJfLGzVaO3rww&h=AT23oiXOTH-t9DE6zHPddh0XnERr6B8QmPAW-mGvvoeuo5zw_YIbCQwO-XMELGeb-skuxXRwppAj_N4PrWNoRJ4QTu1boyF8t6uzo6lXXMLxx0zwE3jp_u3qI7tI5QjQjFIC8w) and using poor products can have negative health benefits.\n\nAccording to the EWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning, [Air Wick](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ewg.org%2Fguides%2Fcategories%2F1-AirFresheners%3Fgrade%3Df%26fbclid%3DIwAR208uotjGjAd6CLniX_Yt4CcdvNZT-TiCcHB2ZKjAYkgV5KZrvNb7CLUVQ&h=AT1lH2cI-m9GdVFOzeL8LG0g_dCAvOizQswPEW_Mn_66SexTobaiIMAv3ycwese7r3Uv_gIM1IqY63KKo1KsPoV9zeYnVYN1uf8mSZskU5I4PdOhjK5y8q9_kUbfHt-HxI_8Ag) (and many other air fresheners) have wholeheartedly earned an “F” grade when it comes to environmental friendliness. This rating takes into consideration the chemicals in the product, its effect on the environment, its sustainability in production, and any negative health effects.\n\nInstead, look to use [great, sustainable products](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ewg.org%2Fguides%2Fcategories%2F1-AirFresheners%3Fgrade%3Da%26fbclid%3DIwAR3gwR3onHkrCntZiuTcYVockMbt_5f_7Bv7VR5P6pYKF_FXDHfHIH2UAgI&h=AT2z_M92riBxfF2AwUR74ORg4_p-yL1i-WbwLpxTedc__Rz-uOX8qVGoyNpdfmxmkFEQ9OBpNPFtiCDUF9O_4BtUZD7LAAAsTRleQCCXIFghrbSqc1lLdFdOPt1114dzfMFvfQ) that work hard to earn an A grade.
