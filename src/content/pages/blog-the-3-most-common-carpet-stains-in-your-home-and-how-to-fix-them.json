The more you try to avoid them, the more often they’ll come. So, it’s best to accept them as a constant and be prepared for the worst.\n\nThese are the 3 [most common carpet stains](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mentalfloss.com%2Farticle%2F503977%2F15-common-stains-and-easy-ways-get-them-out%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR17AoPDtJDxtBC7rObdw9cpmMj-cg8MkMAX-mq6E85-MoJBKOFoEiawpuw&h=AT19CnWHoEZhPHW1XFaLeGaJFs022xGq5efWueXm78P1Cg5fBMB-7OkZ_Ypfomh8Bl7Ae1kds2x62xn6JLkvrzS8FfmOhANaEROJAKsparNhIiR2NUtRuUKVVJlG2UvAuC5pdg) you’ll come across at home and some ways you can treat each and every one.\n\n## How to Cure a Wine Stain\n\nProbably the most common stain talked about on TV and in movies, the dreaded red wine stain has haunted homes for years. So, how can you get it out?\n\nIf it’s spilled on a carpet or a shirt, then you’re in luck. The easiest answer is to toss it into a washing machine with warm water after applying a stain remover.\n\nIf not, things get [a little trickier](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.realsimple.com%2Fhome-organizing%2Fcleaning%2Fcleaning-stain-removal%2Fremove-red-wine-stain%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0vutA9kQCd958Yso5LzAg_gikTd6Wj2_IA222dERiv1wOOqztn-aZuUeY&h=AT12DzFBgvHLBgEs5WiQ7qsRdvdhiOxxCLYEZ9f7JLQuyQJXbN_x_xFdWQ7vMKmQ8yRa_FEmPffIgArL-wJX5oNY-zyOuyitVU2l7LV21dXTAtcx2sNyQAMyrNvxQEPgojRH1w).\n\n1.  First, blot (don’t rub) the stain and soak up as much of the moisture as you can.\n2.  Second, sprinkle an absorbent like salt or baking soda onto the spot and wait a few minutes. These will soak up even more of the liquid and will dive deep into the carpet.\n3.  Last, pour some hot water onto the spot and continue to repeat steps one and two until the stain is gone!\n\n## Getting Blood Out of Your Carpet\n\nIt may not seem so, but blood stains are extremely common in the home. Just from simple cuts to bloody noses, odds are, you’ll run into this problem from time to time.\n\n[Blood can be a little trickier](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhome%2Fcleaning%2Ftips%2Fa16073%2Fremove-blood-stains%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3zpVAf3cU5d7P-Xp7-vEyagC2bvqizocbRSbd3biOe0HQn-JvFZaE1bvM&h=AT2bGc-SnjLBzoC1qwZL6PahHML3Q35KEGhKwZEvg6h4be75joR6_ikAtRzguwDKBXAXTqKvT805Zcjurzs3kLWknAZGShXWuQ-FeiAuwNMdrfJTVgGJRrxKdggu2JvfLtY5og) to get out of your carpet. So, the methods get more intense than dealing with red wine.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1.  Mix some liquid dishwashing detergent (about a tablespoon’s worth) with two cups of water.\n2.  Using your new solution in tandem with a clean sponge, dab the spot until the sponge has soaked up all the blood in the carpet. If the blood has already set, you may need to scrub it with a brush to remove the hardened spots.\n3.  If the spot remains stained, simply repeat the process until the stain is gone.\n\n## Remove the Stain and Smell of Urine\n\nMany of us have pets. Unfortunately, they don’t always behave how we’d like them to.\n\n[Urine stains are a two-part monster.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fspotremoval.coit.com%2Fhow-to-remove-urine-from-carpet%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3oLE547tm9Koe89eYOc5H0Xq57uMDXiTYJkvd8JEFiUJm0z-GGZLmGz2A&h=AT3C91W8NCMCA1jqDkzH6jBbwe_lx2RvjWSeoqvjCZVrucqePXz5dHfroYB1xkR-kIznzWxLaFnnVPzlpLvFvDTq4yjfA1HRimD1Zg-NwsV1_4Kj4q8l8qf6e5O2efScdyfT5w) Not only can the urine stain your carpet, the scent can linger for much longer. Here’s how to deal with both once and for all.\n\nCreate a solution of roughly 50% white vinegar and 50% water. Take it and dampen the afflicted area, then wait a few minutes for the solution to soak deeper into the fibers of the carpet.\n\nNext, you have two options:\n\n*   You can dab the area with paper towels until the stain comes up.\n*   You can sprinkle an absorbent (like baking soda) onto the spot, wait for it to absorb all of the water and vinegar, then vacuum it up.\n\nRepeat this process until both the stain and the scent are gone for good.\n\n### FOR THE TOUGH STAINS\n\nSome stains are naturally tougher to remove than others. To make matters more strenuous, if you’re planning on listing a home, you’re probably on a time crunch.\n\nTo get rid of those tough-to-remove stains promptly, [call in the experts over at The Heiser Group.](https://www.heisergroup.com/realty-cleaning?fbclid=IwAR2CPoe1YxsveuQ12VqlLmivGNB6USBtrhghPjyUtCBhXonxrA7jE4usPug)\n\n‍",
