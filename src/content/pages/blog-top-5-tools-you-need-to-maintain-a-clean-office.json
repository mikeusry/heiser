Conducting a quick vacuuming on a weekly basis will keep the floor free of crumbs, dust, and other debris.\n\n## DISINFECTANTS\n\n[A well-kept supply of disinfectants is important to maintain a healthy office environment](https://woodard247.com/office-cleaning-supplies-checklist/) for everyone at work, especially when cold and flu season comes around. Keeping a strong supply of disinfectants allows you to promote cleanliness and sanitation in those often touched and crucial pieces of equipment like pens, pencils, keyboards, phones, and door handles.\n\nDisinfectants come in many shapes and forms:\n\n*   **Disinfectant Wipes:** A very versatile tool, wipes can be used on everything from cleaning up small spills to quickly and effectively disinfecting any surface of disease-spreading pathogens.\n*   **Hand Sanitizer:** A mainstay for a healthy workforce, keeping some spare hand sanitizer around the office can keep sickness from spreading from one surface to another.\n*   **Disinfectant Spray:** Sometimes, messes consume a larger surface area. For the messes that are too big for wipes, using a spray and paper towel can quickly disinfect large areas.\n\n## AN ALL-SURFACE CLEANER\n\nMesses come in all shapes and sizes so you need a [cleaner with just as much versatility](https://www.quill.com/content/index/resource-center/office-supplies/buying-guides/office-supplies-list/default.cshtml). Going with an all-surface cleaner will let you clean off many surfaces.\n\n## DUSTING SUPPLIES\n\nOften forgotten but just as important as anything else is remembering to dust around the office. Dust can become a cocktail of bacteria, germs, dead skin, and anything else that floats around the office. Investing in a quick Swiffer can make dusting easy but be sure to check all the hard-to-reach areas like high shelves or the space above cabinets.\n\n## MOPPING SUPPLIES\n\nIf your office has tile or wood flooring, you’ll want another option in floor cleaning besides the vacuum. One of the many types of mops, along with a safe cleaning solution, makes quick work of caked on messes and dirt.\n\nIf you’re working with hardwood at the office, make sure to go with a specific hardwood. This way, you can ensure that the finish is protected throughout consistent cleaning.\n\nSome messes are too big to keep under control with mere weekly cleaning around the office. For these instances, it’s more effective to call in the professionals at The Heiser Group.
