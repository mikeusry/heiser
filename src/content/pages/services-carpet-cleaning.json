While regular vacuuming can remove surface dirt, professional carpet shampooing goes beyond the surface to penetrate deep into the fibers, eliminating tough stains, pet dander, allergens and odors.\n\n## **Carpet Cleaning Services**\n\nThe Heiser Group implements two primary methods for specialty carpet cleaning: hot water extraction and bonnet cleaning.\n\n### **Hot Water Extraction**\n\n![Carpet Cleaning and Carpet Shampoo Chicago](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b80d7ae428af6ee4c77f03/65b92bbf3b64e1222c52d68a_carpet-cleaning-chicago-1.jpg)\n\nCommonly known as steam carpet cleaning, our hot water extraction service introduces highly pressurized hot water to agitate the carpet fibers and dissolve dirt in the carpet. This involves applying a cleaning agent, agitating the carpet fibers with a rotary brush and a final rinsing.\n\n### **Bonnet Cleaning**\n\n![Carpet Cleaning and Carpet Shampoo Chicago](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60b80d7ae428af6ee4c77f03/65b92bdf9ef017554ca5350d_carpet-cleaning-chicago-0.jpg)\n\nUnlike hot water extraction, our bonnet cleaning service focuses primarily on the carpet's surface. We apply a heavy duty motorized rotary machine into a cleaning agent, and then apply the spinning bonnet pad to the carpet fibers. This process absorbs dirt from the carpeting and is great for a rapid spot-cleaning.\n\n## Carpet Shampooing Process\n\nAt The Heiser Group, our carpet shampooing process is designed to leave your carpets fresh and odor-free. While specific steps of the process may differ depending on your selected service, the end result remains the same: clean carpets.\n\n### Pre-Cleaning Inspection\n\nWe understand that every carpet is different, with specific cleaning requirements. That's why our carpet shampooing process begins with a comprehensive pre-cleaning inspection. Our trained technicians assess the condition of your carpet, taking note of any stains, pet accidents or high-traffic areas that require special attention. This inspection allows us to tailor our cleaning approach to your specific needs, ensuring the best results. By identifying problem areas, we can effectively treat stains, remove deep-seated dirt and restore the beauty of your carpets. Our attention to detail during the pre-cleaning inspection sets the stage for a thorough and effective carpet shampooing process that exceeds your expectations.\n\n### Stain and Spot Treatment\n\nOur carpet shampooing process includes specialized stain and spot treatment to target stubborn stains and blemishes. To effectively tackle stains, we use professional stain removers and natural carpet cleaner, minimizing the use of harsh chemicals. Our stain and spot treatment process includes:\n\n*   Identification of tough stains and spots\n*   Application of stain remover on problem areas\n*   Gentle scrubbing to break down stains\n*   Extraction of loosened stains and residue\n*   Thorough rinsing to remove any remaining traces of stains\n\n### Deep Cleaning Shampoo\n\nAfter stain and spot treatment, our carpet shampooing process moves on to deep cleaning shampoo. We use a professional carpet cleaning machine, along with our professional strength carpet shampoo, to penetrate deep into the carpet fibers and efficiently remove embedded dirt, allergens, pet dander and odor. Our deep cleaning shampoo ensures a thorough clean, revitalizing your carpets and leaving them fresh and clean. With our expertise and state-of-the-art equipment, we guarantee that our deep cleaning shampoo delivers the best way to clean carpets.\n\n### Rinsing and Extraction\n\nRinsing and extraction are crucial steps in our carpet shampooing process, ensuring the removal of cleaning agents, residue and contaminants from your carpets. Our professional carpet cleaner thoroughly rinses your carpets, which eliminates any traces of shampoo and leaves them clean, fresh and residue-free. Then, the extraction process takes place, effectively removing any remaining dirt, allergens and odor to achieve a deep clean.\n\n### Final Inspection and Client Approval\n\nAt The Heiser Group, customer satisfaction is our top priority. That's why our carpet shampooing process concludes with a final inspection and client approval. Our trained technicians thoroughly inspect your carpets, ensuring that every aspect of our cleaning process has been completed successfully. We want to make sure that you are completely satisfied with our service, and we invite you to review the last test results and provide feedback. Your approval is our guarantee that our professional carpet shampooing process has met our commitment to quality.\n\n## Our Expertise in Carpet Shampooing\n\nWhen you choose The Heiser Group for your carpet shampooing needs, you can trust that your carpets are in good hands.\n\n### Efficient Tools and Techniques\n\nWe use top-of-the-line equipment to ensure a thorough and efficient clean. Our carpet cleaning machine is designed to effectively remove dirt, stains and odor, leaving your carpets clean and revitalized. Our efficient tools and cleaning techniques provide a deep, effective clean.\n\n### Commitment to Quality Service\n\nOur commitment to quality service is at the core of everything we do. It is reflected in our professional team who is dedicated to providing the best carpet cleaning experience for our clients. It is also reflected in our use of only the best quality cleaning products and equipment, ensuring a deep clean that exceeds expectations.\n\n### Customer Satisfaction\n\nWe take pride in our work and always ensure that our clients are completely satisfied with our service.
