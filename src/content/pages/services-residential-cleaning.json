On average, carpets typically take around 4–6 hours to dry completely.\n\n‍\n\nIs professional carpet shampooing safe for pets and children?\n\nYes, professional carpet shampooing is safe for pets and children when done by a reputable company like The Heiser Group. To avoid any slips or falls, it is recommended to keep pets and children away from freshly cleaned carpets until they have dried completely.\n\n‍\n\nWhat do professionals use to clean carpets?\n\nProfessionals use a combination of powerful carpet cleaning machines and specially formulated cleaning solutions. These machines work by injecting hot water and cleaning solution into the carpet fibers, agitating them to loosen dirt and stains. The machines then extract the dirty water, leaving your carpets fresh and clean. Professionals may also use a spot treatment for a tough stain, such as a pet stain, and high-powered extraction tools for thorough rinsing.\n\n‍\n\n## Still have questions?\n\nContact The Heiser Group today!\n\n[Contact](https://www.heisergroup.com/contact)",
