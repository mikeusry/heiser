  "markdown": "# Specialty Cleaning\n\n#### No Mess.  \nLess Stress.\n\n\"Good enough\" is not an option for us! For a professional cleaning service in Chicagoland that gets the job done right, contact The Heiser Group today.\n\n## Specialty Cleaning FAQ's\n\nIs professional carpet cleaning effective?\n\nYes, professional carpet cleaning is highly effective in removing dirt, stains and odors from your carpets. Through specialized techniques and a professional strength formula, carpet cleaning can improve the air quality in your home by eliminating allergens and bacteria that may be trapped in the carpet fibers.\n\nWhat is the difference between carpet cleaning and upholstery cleaning?\n\nCarpet cleaning refers to cleaning carpet, while upholstery cleaning refers to cleaning fabric of furniture.\n\nIs professional carpet cleaning better than doing it yourself?\n\nWhile a DIY mixture of warm water and cleaner may seem like a cost-effective option, professional carpet cleaning offers several advantages. Professional carpet cleaners have access to powerful equipment and specialized cleaning solutions that can effectively remove deep-seated dirt, stubborn stains and unpleasant odors. Professionals are also trained in proper carpet cleaning techniques, ensuring a thorough and efficient job.\n\nDIY carpet cleaning often involves renting or purchasing less powerful machines that may not provide the same level of cleanliness. When using a new cleaning solution or unique blend, it is recommended to test it on an inconspicuous area for color fastness. Using incorrect cleaning solutions can lead to damage to your carpets or ineffective results.\n\nProfessional carpet cleaning also saves you time and effort. Cleaning your carpets yourself can be a time-consuming task, especially if you have a large area to cover.\n\nHow long does the carpet take to dry after professional shampooing?\n\nThe drying time for carpets after professional shampooing can vary depending on various factors, such as humidity, ventilation, soil and carpet thickness. On average, carpets typically take around 4–6 hours to dry completely.\n\n‍\n\nWhat do professionals use to clean carpets?\n\nProfessionals use a combination of powerful carpet cleaning machines and specially formulated cleaning solutions. These machines work by injecting hot water and cleaning solution into the carpet fibers, agitating them to loosen dirt and stains. The machines then extract the dirty water, leaving your carpets fresh and clean. Professionals may also use a spot treatment for a tough stain, such as a pet stain, and high-powered extraction tools for thorough rinsing.\n\n‍\n\n## Still have questions?\n\nContact The Heiser Group today!\n\n[Contact](https://www.heisergroup.com/contact)",
